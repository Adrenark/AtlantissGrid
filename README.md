# AtlantissGrid

 AtlantissGrid is an Atlantiss (one of World of Warcraft private servers) version of addon Grid.

Grid is the original compact unit frame addon.

The compact grid of units lets you select a group member quickly, while keeping a good overview of the whole group. 
Grid is designed to show you only what you need to know, and not overload you with irrelevant information. 
It is highly configurable, letting you choose exactly what is shown, and how it's shown. There are also many plugins that add even more features!

Grid was originally conceived and written by Maia and Pastamancer in late 2006. Phanx has been the primary developer since late 2009. 
Jerry wrote the original pet support code. Mikk designed the icon. jlam added some advanced options for auras. 
Greltok and Stassart have helped a lot with bugfixing. Finally, lots of people have contributed translations!

I'm not the original owner of this program. If you're its right owner you can contact me and it will be removed.
